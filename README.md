## Executive Summary (Leadership-ready)
This dashboard translates passenger survey and operational data into a clear product narrative:

- **Baseline KPI:** Satisfaction rate is ~44% (test set in the original notebook work), indicating meaningful upside for experience improvement.
- **Strong experience linkage:** A composite **Experience Index** (mean of all touchpoint ratings) separates satisfied vs not satisfied passengers clearly.
- **Top opportunities (impact × headroom):** **Inflight Wi‑Fi**, **Online boarding**, and **Check‑in service** emerge as the highest-leverage initiatives from modeling + prioritization.

### Estimated KPI uplift (what-if simulation)
Scenario used for prioritization (not causal): increase a touchpoint rating by **+1** for passengers scoring **≤ 3** (capped at 5), and measure average predicted satisfaction change.

Example estimates from the notebook exports:
- **Inflight Wi‑Fi:** **+1.44 pp**
- **Online boarding:** **+1.00 pp**
- **Check‑in service:** **+0.26 pp**

> These are **scenario estimates** intended for prioritization and stakeholder communication.

---

## Key definitions (used in charts & tables)

- **Satisfaction Rate**
  - Percentage of passengers labeled **satisfied**.
- **Touchpoint Average Score**
  - Mean rating (0–5) for each experience touchpoint.
- **Satisfaction Gap**
  - `avg(touchpoint | satisfied) − avg(touchpoint | not satisfied)`  
  - Higher gap = stronger differentiator for satisfaction.
- **Experience Index**
  - Mean of all touchpoint ratings for each passenger (0–5 scale).
- **Permutation Importance (Driver Strength)**
  - Measures the drop in model AUC when a feature is shuffled.  
  - Higher AUC drop = feature is more predictive.
- **Opportunity Score (Prioritization)**
  - `opportunity_score = importance_mean × score_headroom`
  - `score_headroom = 5 − avg_score_all`
  - Prioritizes touchpoints that are **high impact** and **underperforming**.
- **What‑if Impact Simulation**
  - A transparent scenario: improve low scores (≤3) by +1 and estimate satisfaction lift.  
  - Useful for communicating “expected direction and magnitude” to stakeholders.

### Required
- `app.py`
- `test.csv`
- `requirements.txt`

### Recommended
- `outputs/` (generated by the notebook export) to unlock model-based tables and lift estimates:
  - `permutation_importance_all_features.csv`

## Run locally (Conda, macOS)

```bash
conda create -n qa-dashboard python=3.11 -y
conda activate qa-dashboard
conda install -c conda-forge pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn streamlit -y
streamlit run app.py
```

Optional (only if you want to re-run the modeling notebook in the same environment):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost shap -y
```

---

## Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)
1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Go to Streamlit Community Cloud → **New app**
3. Select:
   - **Repo:** this repository
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Main file:** `app.py`
4. Deploy and add the live URL to the **Live Demo** section above.

Tip: If you need to force a Python version, add `runtime.txt`:
```
python-3.11
```

## Notes on data & cleaning
The app performs lightweight, transparent preprocessing:
- Drops an index-like column (`Unnamed: 0`) if present
- Standardizes categorical labels (`Customer Type`, `Type of Travel`)
- Median-imputes missing `Arrival Delay in Minutes`
- Creates `is_satisfied` and `experience_index` for KPI reporting

---

## How to interpret the Opportunity Map (Executive View)
The Opportunity Map plots each touchpoint by:
- **Performance** (Avg score) on the X-axis
- **Impact** (Satisfaction gap) on the Y-axis

Use the quadrants to prioritize:
- **Low performance + high impact:** highest priority initiatives
- **High performance + high impact:** protect strengths
- **Low performance + low impact:** investigate (may be low leverage)
- **High performance + low impact:** lower priority

---

## Limitations (important for credibility)
- This analysis is **not causal**: model explainability and what‑if lifts reflect association, not guaranteed outcomes.
- Touchpoint ratings are self-reported and can be closely tied to satisfaction labels (inflating predictive performance).
- Treat uplift numbers as **directional** until validated through controlled pilots or experiments.

## Portfolio talking points

1. **Defined product KPIs and built a leadership scorecard**
   - Defined two headline KPIs for product decision-making: **Satisfaction Rate** and an **Experience Index** (average of all touchpoint ratings).
   - Established a clear baseline: **43.90% satisfaction (test)** and **43.33% (train)** to support consistent reporting.
   - Packaged the KPIs into an **Executive View** designed for fast, leadership-level consumption.

2. **Isolated what’s underperforming vs what truly differentiates satisfaction**
   - Identified the lowest-rated experience areas (pain points): **Inflight Wi-Fi (2.72)**, **Ease of Online Booking (2.76)**, **Gate Location (2.98)**.
   - Identified the strongest differentiators between satisfied vs not satisfied passengers using the **satisfaction gap** metric:
     - **Online Boarding (+1.35)**, **Inflight Entertainment (+1.08)**, **Seat Comfort (+0.92)**.
   - Added segment context to guide product focus:
     - **Class:** Business **69.52%** vs Eco **19.39%**
     - **Type of Travel:** Business Travel **58.82%** vs Personal Travel **9.99%**
     - **Customer Type:** Loyal **48.14%** vs Disloyal **25.17%**

3. **Built an explainable driver model to support prioritization**
   - Trained a high-performing model and used **permutation importance (AUC drop)** to explain which factors matter most—an approach that is easy to communicate to non-technical stakeholders.
   - Key drivers included:
     - **Inflight Wi-Fi** (importance_mean **0.120**) — strongest touchpoint driver
     - Context drivers: **Type of Travel (0.079)** and **Customer Type (0.020)**
     - Digital/ground journey levers: **Online Boarding (0.0066)** and **Check-in Service (0.0036)**

4. **Translated analytics into a ranked opportunity list with quantified impact**
   - Created an **Opportunity Score** that combines *impact* and *headroom*:  
     `opportunity_score = importance × (5 − average score)`
   - Top priorities:
     1) **Inflight Wi-Fi** (opportunity_score **0.274**)  
     2) **Online Boarding** (**0.0115**)  
     3) **Check-in Service** (**0.0060**)  
   - Estimated KPI movement using a transparent “what-if” simulation (improving low scores ≤3 by +1, capped at 5):
     - **Inflight Wi-Fi:** **+1.44 pp** (eligible population **69.71%**)  
     - **Online Boarding:** **+1.00 pp** (eligible population **49.90%**)  
     - **Check-in Service:** **+0.26 pp** (eligible population **51.72%**)  
   - Positioned these as **directional estimates for prioritization**, to be validated via pilots/A/B tests.

5. **Delivered a stakeholder-ready dashboard with drilldowns and execution tracking**
   - Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard with:
     - **Executive View** (KPI cards + Opportunity Map)
     - **Experience Deep Dive** (touchpoint performance + segment KPIs)
     - **Model & Opportunities** (drivers + opportunity ranking + lift scenarios)
     - **Segment drilldown page** (Business vs Personal travel)
   - Included an **initiative-tracking foundation** (targets/status via `initiatives.csv`) and a **CSV export** feature to support reporting workflows and stakeholder sharing.
